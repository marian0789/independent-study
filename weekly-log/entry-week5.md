# Entry 5 


Want to know what else SASS allows us to do? Mathematical Functions to compute measurementsâ€”including colors.

This is how Sass computes colors:

You need to have Red, green, and blue components, in order for the operation to be performed. 
It computes the answer by operating on every two digits.
```css $color: #010203 + #040506; ```
The above would compute piece-wise as follows:
```css
01 + 04 = 05
02 + 05 = 07
03 + 06 = 09
```
and compile to:

```css color: #050709; ```
Sass arithmetic can also compute HSLA and string colors such as red and blue.
