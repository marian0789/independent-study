SASS


SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets
SASS is like CSS but it is shorter way to code than CSS
Neat 

SASS also has 3 concepts
Variables
Mixins
Nests

SASS uses $ to define and reference a variable






sass main.scss main.css 

This code snippet lets us first compile SASS to CSS. The snippet takes two arguments 
1. The input (main.scss)
2. The location of where to place that output (main.css)





****To define & reference variables you have to use  $ ******   (this connects to global variables!)


Sass has two other data types: 
  - lists 
  - maps

Maps means that each object is a key-value pair. the value of a key can be a list/another map.
Nesting and variables are two ways that keeps Sass stylesheets clean. 

Example of Map key code

(key1: value1, key2: value2);
